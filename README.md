Welcome to the Eventlist!

I utilized JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in the development of this model, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern.

Users are able to add a new event by clicking "Add New Event" button at the top, then fill out the input fields with its name, start, end dates, and then save it.
Users are able to remove the event by clicking the delete button.
Users are able to edit the event by clicking the edit icon, and click the save icon again to save it.
Users can edit multiple elements at once, removing or editing one element won't affect other elements

It is a very powerful tool for the users to manage their time and move a huge step to success!!!!!!

It is responsive so that you can use it in any browser and device! You have the ticket to success in almost any time and place!!!

At last, thanks Brandon for teaching me so many useful knowledge which is essential to this project.
