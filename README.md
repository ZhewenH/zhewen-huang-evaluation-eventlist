Welcome to the eventlist!

I used javascript, css, and html to create this model. In the whole process, I used MVC.

Users are able to add a new event by clicking "Add New Event" button at the top, then fill out the input fields with its name, start, end dates, and then save it.
Users are able to remove the event by clicking the delete button.
Users are able to edit the event by clicking the edit icon, and click the save icon again to save it.
